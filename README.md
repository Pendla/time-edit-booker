# TimeEdit Study room booker
This is a utility script that sends requests to the TimeEdit system for Chalmers University of Technology in order to book a study room.

## TODO
* Sort the users by the number of available bookings they have and book a room with them in that order.

I will gladly consider any pull requests submitted. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Email available through my profile here at github (Pendla).

## Disclaimer
I do not take any responsibility in which way this is used. This was developed solely for educational purposes. I DO NOT recommend using
this in any way that compromises the system for other students at the university.
